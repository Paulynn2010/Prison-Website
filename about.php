    Introduction

It is located in Hume, Australian Capital Territory. The facility is operated by ACT Corrective Services, an agency of the Government of the Australian Capital Territory. </p>
<p>The facility accepts remands charged under Territory and/or Commonwealth legislation pending legal proceedings; and also detains convicted offenders who are sentenced to full-time imprisonment. The centre is named in honour of penal reformer Alexander Maconochie, who worked in Van Diemenâ€™s Land (Tasmania) and Norfolk Island from 1836 to 1844,[3] and is the Territory's first prison.</p>
